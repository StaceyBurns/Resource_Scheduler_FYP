"A Resource Management Web Application for Scheduling Multiple Varying Resources"

Created as part of my final year project for BSc (Hons) in Creative Multimedia.

This web app is being developed through Angular and Firabase and aims to provide users with a more flexible way of scheduling their resources, moving away from the people and team centric schedulers available, this app will cater for resource to resource allocation, resource dependencies and offer a less restrictive environment for managing unpredictable resources.
